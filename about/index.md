My dad, Philip J. Pettican, spoke to me one day about a dream of his: having a website called Pettican Junction were people from the Pettican family could submit their part of the family tree. Sort of like [Ancestry.co.uk](http://www.ancestry.co.uk) but more personal and totally free!

I am updating this website whenever I can, so if anybody in the Pettican family is a web-developer your help would be greatly appreciated üòÑ! Just fork the repo down bellow. As for everybody else, show some love by giving the project a ‚≠êÔ∏è bellow!
