So if you had a browse and read the about page you will know the reason behind the creation of this website. Either way I'll say it again: 

> My dad, Philip J. Pettican, spoke to me one day about a dream of his: having a website called Pettican Junction were people from the Pettican family could submit their part of the family tree. Sort of like [Ancestry.co.uk](http://www.ancestry.co.uk) but more personal and totally free!

There you have it. I'm quite busy at the moment so I will complete this post some other time!
